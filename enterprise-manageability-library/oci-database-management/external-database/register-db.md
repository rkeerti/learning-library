# Register an Oracle Database with External Database Service

## Introduction

You can manage and monitor Oracle Databases that are located outside of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) using OCI's External Database service. External Database allows you to use cloud-based tools such as Database Management with your external databases. External Database can be used with both single-instance Oracle Databases and Oracle RAC instances.

Follow **Task 1** to manually register the databases with External Database Service or **Task 2** to register the databases with External Database Service using Terraform and Resource Manager.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

-   Manually register the Container Databases (CDBs) and Pluggable Databases (PDBs) with External Database Service.
-   Register the Container Databases (CDBs) and Pluggable Databases (PDBs) with External Database Service using Terraform and Resource Manager.
-   After registering databases enable Database Management service.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have already completed the following:
- Lab: Generate SSH Key (FreeTier and Paid accounts)
- Lab: Environment Setup or Verify Setup
- Lab: Setup pluggable databases and workload
- Lab: Prerequisite: Create a dynamic group and policies for agent communication
- Lab: Download and Install the Management Agent Software

	![](./images/externalcontainerdb3.png " ")
	![](./images/externalcontainerdb4.png " ")     
	![](./images/externalcontainerdb5.png " ")

     This will take a few minutes to register your Container Database as External Container Database.

6.  Go to **External Container Database Details** page and confirm that the External Container Database is **AVAILABLE**.

	![](./images/externalcontainerdb6.png " ")

7.  On the **External Container Database Details** page, scroll down and on the left panel under **Resources** click **External Pluggable Databases** and then click **Register External Pluggable Database**.

     This will take a few minutes to register your Pluggable Database as External Pluggable Database.

11.  Go to **External Pluggable Database Details** page and confirm that the External Pluggable Database is **AVAILABLE**.

	![](./images/externalpdb5.png " ")

12.  Perform steps 7 to 11 to add other pluggable databases with these service names - **FINANCE**, **SALES**, **HRSTAGE** and **HRUAT**.

13.  On Oracle Cloud Console, click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Oracle Database** and click **External Database**. Verify all pluggable databases are registered under External pluggable databases.

     ![](./images/pluggabledatabases.png " ")

     Congratulations, your databases are registered !

     There is no need to perform Task 2 to 4 after registering your databases manually.
     Directly go to **Task 5: Enable Database Management**

## Task 2: Register External Databases (Using Terraform)

1. Log in to the Oracle Cloud Console, click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Developer Services**, and select **Stacks**.

	![](../setup-on-premises-environment/images/developer-resmgr-stacks.png " ")

     ![](../setup-on-premises-environment/images/createstackpage.png " ")

2. Check the **.zip file**, Click the **Browse** link and select the external database setup zip file (`external-db.zip`) that you downloaded. Click **Open** to upload the zip file.

     ![](../setup-on-premises-environment/images/createstack1.png " ")

     Accept defaults and click **Next**.

3. Use the below details to fill up the variables,  and click **Next**. Verify management\_agent\_display\_name is set to Management Agent installed ealier. Hostname is the name of the compute instance provisioned ealier.

    ```
    <copy>
    management_agent_display_name = dbm_demo
    container_database_name = ORCL
    connector_credential_name = orcl.cred
    connector_username = SYSTEM

    connector_hostname = workshop.subnet1.labvcn.oraclevcn.com
    connector_port = 1521
    connector_protocol = TCP
    connector_service = ORCL
    connector_name  = CDB-CON
    license_model = BYOL
    </copy>
    ```
For pluggable\_databases array, copy the below values and paste under pluggable_databases field

    ```
    <copy>

5. Click **Next**, review the data and click **Create**

     ![](./images/createstack3.png " ")

5. Your stack has now been created! Now you can create your environment.
     ![](./images/stackcreated.png " ")

## Task 3: Terraform Plan (OPTIONAL)

When using Resource Manager to deploy an environment, execute a terraform **Plan** to verify the configuration. This is an optional step in this lab.

1.  [OPTIONAL] Click **Plan** to validate your configuration. This takes about a minute, please be patient.

     ![](./images/planjob1.png " ")

     ![](./images/planjob2.png " ")

## Task 4: Terraform Apply

When using Resource Manager to deploy an environment, execute a terraform **Apply**. Let's do that now.

1.  At the top of your page, click **Stack Details**.  Click the button, **Apply**. This will register your Container and Pluggable Databases under External Database. This takes about 10 minutes, please be patient.

     ![](./images/applyjob1.png " ")

     ![](./images/applyjob2.png " ")

2.  Once this job succeeds, you will get an apply complete notification from Terraform. Congratulations, your databases are registered !

## Task 5: Enable Database Management

1.  Log in to the Oracle Cloud Console, click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and select **External Database**. Click **Pluggable Databases** and verify all pluggable databases are registered under External pluggable databases.

     ![](./images/pluggabledatabases.png " ")

2.  Click the database registered under External pluggable databases to display **External Pluggable Database** Details.

     ![](./images/pluggabledbdetails.png " ")

3.  Click on **Enable** against Database Management.

     ![](./images/enableplugdbmgmt.png " ")

4.  Select an external database connector  and click **Enable**.

     ![](./images/enableplugdbmgmt1.png " ")

5.  Perform steps 4-6 for all pluggable databases registered under External pluggable databases.

6.  Under **External Databases**, click on **Container Databases** and verify container database is registered under External Container Databases.

     ![](./images/containerdatabases.png " ")

7.  Click on the database registered under External Container Databases to display External Container Database Details.

     ![](./images/containerdatabasedetails.png " ")

8. Click on **Enable** against Database Management.

     ![](./images/enabledatabasemgmt.png " ")

9. Select **external database connector** and **choose a license type** - **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)**. Click **Enable**.

     ![](./images/enabledbmgmt1.png " ")

10. Now that we have some databases defined and the service configured, from the Cloud Console go back to the navigation menu and select the **Database Management** selection to monitor and manage the databases.
