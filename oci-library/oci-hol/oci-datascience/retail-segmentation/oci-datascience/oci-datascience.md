# Get Started with OCI Data Science

## Introduction

This lab will guide you on provisioning an OCI Data Science environment.

Estimated lab time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab you will:
* Become familiar with the set up of the OCI Data Science service.

### Prerequisites

* Access to your Oracle Cloud console.

## **Step 1:** Provision OCI Data Science

This guide shows you how to provision the OCI Data Science service on the Oracle Cloud Console.

1. In your Oracle CLoud Console, open the menu.

2. Select Analytics & AI -> Data Science.

    Data Science should be under the Machine Learning category.

    Name and Description are optional but may help you find your project more easily later.

## **Step 2:** Create a Data Science Notebook

Now we can create the Data Science Notebook.

1. Click Create Notebook Session

2. Fill out Necessary Information

    ![Create Notebook Page](./images/createnotebookpage.png)

    Once again, name is optional, but preferred.

    For Compute, VM.Standard.E2.2 will work.

    For our project, 100 GB in Block Storage Size is suitable, but even something as low as 50 GB should work.

3. Click the Open Button.

    We will be returning to this data science notebook later to use it, but for now we are opening it to make sure that it has been created properly.
    Feel free to close the page and open it again later.

    You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
