# Lab 2: Understand Data, Download Samples, Prepare data, Create Project

## Introduction

In this session, we will discuss the data requirements and data formats required by our APIs through some examples. 


***Estimated Time***: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Understand the data requirements and data formats for training model and forecast 
- Download prepared sample datasets
- Upload the downloaded dataset into Data Science Notebook Session

### Prerequisites
- A Free tier or paid tenancy account in OCI
- You have completed all the tasks in Lab 1

## Task 1: Understand Data Requirements
 Our forecasting service provides an AutoML solution with multiple univariate/multivariate algorithms that can run on single series or multiple series at once. For this, there are some data validations and data format requirements that the input data must satisfy.
### **Data Validations**
For a successful forecast, the input data should pass the following data validations:

* Number of rows for a time series >= 10 and <= 5000
* Series length >= 3 X Forecast Horizon
* Series length >= 2 X Major Seasonality
* If the series is non-seasonal, at least one non-seasonal method needs to be available for running.
* If ensemble method is selected, at least 2 other methods need to be selected as well.
* Number of missing values <= 10% of series length
* If there are missing values for 5 consecutive time steps, throw an error.
* All the timestamps in the primary data source should exist in the secondary data source also the number of rows in the additional data source should be equal to the number of rows in the primary data source + forecast horizon size (adjusted by input and output frequency).
* Check if there are any duplicate dates in timeseries after grouping also (Check for both additional and primary data).
* All values have to be >= 0.

### **Data format requirements**
The data should contain one timestamp column and other columns for target variable and series id (if using grouped data).
- timestamp column should contain dates in standard [ISO 8601]('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601') format e.g., 2020-07-13T00:00:00Z. If the input date doesn't follow this format then it needs to be converted in the required format. Python code for converting different date strings to ISO 8601 format is provided in Step 2 of Task 4 in this lab.
- target_column should contain target values of time series. For example it be sales number of a sales data 
- series_id column should contain identifiers for different series e.g., if the data is having sales for different products, then series id can have product codes. 

**Note**: The column names used in the examples here are just for representation and actual data can have diffrent custom names.  

Currently, our APIs support datasets that can be in one of the following formats:

**1. Single time series without any additional data:**
Such datasets have only two columns in them. The first column should be a timestamp column and the second column should be the target column.

**Here is a sample CSV-formatted data:**
```csv
timestamp,target_column
2020-07-13T00:00:00Z,20
2020-07-14T00:00:00Z,30
2020-07-15T00:00:00Z,28
...
...
```
**2. Multiple time series without any additional data:** 
The input data can have multiple time series in it(grouped data). For such datasets there must be a column to identify different time-series.

**Here is a sample CSV-formatted data:**
```csv
timestamp,target_column,series_id
2020-07-13T00:00:00Z,20,A
2020-07-14T00:00:00Z,30,A
2020-07-15T00:00:00Z,28,A
....
....
2020-07-13T00:00:00Z,40,B
2020-07-14T00:00:00Z,50,B
2020-07-15T00:00:00Z,28,B
....
....
2020-07-13T00:00:00Z,10,C
2020-07-14T00:00:00Z,20,C
2020-07-15T00:00:00Z,30,C
....
....
``` 
**3. Time series with additional data:** 
The input data can have additional influencers that help in forecasting. We call the two datasets as primary and additional. The primary data should have three columns - timestamp, target column and a column for series id. The additional data should have a timestamp column, a series id column and columns for additional influencers.   

**Here is a sample CSV-formatted data:**

Primary data 
```csv
timestamp,target_column,series_id
2020-07-13T00:00:00Z,20,A
2020-07-14T00:00:00Z,30,A
2020-07-15T00:00:00Z,28,A
....
....
2020-07-13T00:00:00Z,40,B
2020-07-14T00:00:00Z,50,B
2020-07-15T00:00:00Z,28,B
....
....
2020-07-13T00:00:00Z,10,C
2020-07-14T00:00:00Z,20,C
2020-07-15T00:00:00Z,30,C
....
....
```
Additional data 
```csv
timestamp,feature_1,series_id
2020-07-13T00:00:00Z,0,A
2020-07-14T00:00:00Z,1,A
2020-07-15T00:00:00Z,2,A
....
....
2020-07-13T00:00:00Z,0,B
2020-07-14T00:00:00Z,0,B
2020-07-15T00:00:00Z,1,B
....
....
2020-07-13T00:00:00Z,1,C
2020-07-14T00:00:00Z,0,C
2020-07-15T00:00:00Z,0,C
....
....
```
The service currently accepts *Inline Data* that can be generated from csv files.
Steps on how to generate inline data from csv files are given in Task 3 below.
**Note:**
* Missing values are permitted (with empty), data is sorted by timestamp, and boolean flag values should be converted to numeric (0/1).
* The last row of input data should be an observation and not an empty row. 

## Task 2: Download Sample Data

Here is a sample dataset to help you to easily understand how the input data looks like, Download the files to your local machine.

* [Primary data](files/favorita-13-beverages-primary.csv)
* [Additional data](files/favorita-13-beverages-add.csv)
  

## Task 3: Upload Data to Data Science Notebook

You need to upload the sample training data into data science notebook, to be used for *inline data* preparation for model training in next steps.

Click on upload and then browse to file which you desire to upload:
![](images/lab2-task3-upload-data.png " ")

## Task 4: Inline Data preparation

### 1 :
Import below necessary python modules for executing the scripts:

```Python
import pandas as pd
import requests
import json
import ast
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import re
import os
import simplejson
```

### 2 :
You need to load the data in notebook via below mentioned python commands in a data frame
Specify the correct path for the csv file that has the time series data.

```Python
df_primary = pd.read_csv('favorita-13-beverages-primary.csv')
df_add = pd.read_csv('favorita-13-beverages-add.csv')
```

### 3 :
Convert the date field to "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss" format with below commands
Use this link https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior for other date time formats

```Python
# modify date format
df_primary['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_primary['date'],
                                        format='%d/%m/%y').apply(lambda x: str(x))
# modify date format
df_add['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_add['date'],
                                        format='%d/%m/%y').apply(lambda x: str(x))
```

### 4 :
#### Setting variables to create forecast with below commands
- prim_load : is the variable having inline primary data
- add_load : is the variable having inline additional data 

```Python
#primary data
col_order = ['date','sales','item_id']
prim_load = df_primary[col_order].values.transpose().tolist()
prim_load
```

```Json
[['2013-01-01 00:00:00',
  '2013-01-02 00:00:00',
  '2013-01-03 00:00:00',
  '2013-01-04 00:00:00',
  '2013-01-05 00:00:00',
  ...],

  ...]]
  ```


## Task 5 : Create Project ID 
Once, the data is prepared , you  will learn how to create the forecasting service project.
In the payload:
- compartmentId  will be same as tenancy id. Please visit Lab1 API Key generation.  
- displayName can be given any custom name
- description can be customized

```Python
url = "https://forecasting.---------------------.oraclecloud.com/20220101/projects"

payload = json.dumps({
  "displayName": "Forecast API Demo",
  "compartmentId": "ocid-------------------",
  "description": "Forecasting service API Demo",
  "freeformTags": None,
  "definedTags": None,
  "systemTags": None
})
headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload, auth=auth)
```
We store the response 
```Python
create_project_response = json.loads(response.text)
create_project_response
```

```Json
{"id":"ocid.forecastproject..-----------",
"displayName":"Forecast API Demo",
"compartmentId":"ocid.tenancy.----------",
"description":"Forecasting service API Demo",
"timeCreated":"2021-11-18T05:18:58.737Z",
"timeUpdated":"2021-11-18T05:18:58.737Z",
"lifecycleState":"ACTIVE",
"freeformTags":{},
"definedTags":{"Oracle-Tags":{"CreatedBy":"demo_user_2","CreatedOn":"2021-11-18T05:18:58.568Z"}},"systemTags":{}}
```
We store the compartment id and project id which will be used when calling create forecast API. 
```Python
project_id = create_project_response['id']
compartment_id = create_project_response['compartmentId']
```


**Note** : It is not needed to create new projects everytime we run this notebook. A project id once created can be used again and again.

Congratulations on completing this lab!

You may now proceed to the next lab
