## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to quickly provision an Oracle Autonomous Database on Oracle Cloud. 

### Objectives

-   Getting Started with Oracle Database

### Prerequisites

-   This lab requires completion of the **Getting Started** section in the Contents menu on the left.  


## Task 1: Choose ADW from the Services Menu

1. Log in to the Oracle Cloud.
2. Once you are logged in, you are taken to the cloud services dashboard where you can see all the services available to you. Click the navigation menu in the upper left to show top level navigation choices.

3. Click **Autonomous Data Warehouse**.

## Task 2: Creating the Autonomous Database Instance

1. Click **Create Autonomous Database** to start the instance creation process.


    ![](./images/picture100-23.png " ")


2.  This brings up the __Create Autonomous Database__ screen where you will specify the configuration of the instance.
3. Provide basic information for the autonomous database:

    - __Choose a compartment__ - Select a compartment for the database from the drop-down list.
    - __Display Name__ - Enter a memorable name for the database for display purposes. For this lab, use __FirstName LastName__ example (John Smith).
    - __Database Name__ - Use letters and numbers only, starting with a letter. Maximum length is 14 characters. (Underscores not initially supported.) For this lab, use __YOURNAME__ example (JOHNSMITH).

4. Choose a workload type. Select the workload type for your database from the choices:

    - __Data Warehouse__ - For this lab, choose __Data Warehouse__ as the workload type.
    - __Transaction Processing__ - Alternately, you could have chosen Transaction Processing as the workload type.

5. Choose a deployment type. Select the deployment type for your database from the choices:

    - __Shared Infrastructure__ - For this lab, choose __Shared Infrastructure__ as the deployment type.
    - __Dedicated Infrastructure__ - Alternately, you could have chosen Dedicated Infrastructure as the workload type.

    ![](./images/picture100-26-deployment-type.png " ")

6. Configure the database:

    - __Always Free__ - For this lab, you can select this option to create an always free autonomous database, or not select this option and create a database using your paid subscription. An always free database comes with 1 CPU and 20 GB of storage.
    - __Choose database version__ - Leave default - __19c__.
    - __OCPU count__ - Leave default __1 CPU__. If you choose an always free database, it comes with 1 CPU.
    - __Storage (TB)__ - Leave default. 
    - __Auto Scaling__ - Leave default.
    - __New Database Preview__ - If a checkbox is available to preview a new database version, do __not__ select it.

    *Note: You cannot scale up/down an Always Free autonomous database.*

7. Create administrator credentials:

    - __Password and Confirm Password__ - Specify the password for ADMIN user of the service instance. The password must meet the following requirements:
    - The password must be between 12 and 30 characters long and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric character.
    - The password cannot contain the username.
    - The password cannot contain the double quote (") character.
    - The password must be different from the last 4 passwords used.
    - The password must not be the same password that is set less than 24 hours ago.
    - Re-enter the password to confirm it. Make a note of this password.

8. Choose network access:
    - For this lab, accept the default, "Allow secure access from everywhere".
   
    ![](./images/picture100-26e.png " ")
    
9. Choose a license type. For this lab, choose __Bring Your Own License (BYOL)__. The two license types are:

10. Click __Create Autonomous Database__.

11.  Your instance will begin provisioning. In a few minutes the state will turn from Provisioning to Available. At this point, your Autonomous Data Warehouse database is ready to use! Have a look at your instance's details here including its name, database version, CPU count and storage size.

## Task 3: Connect with SQL Worksheet

Although you can connect to your autonomous database from local PC desktop tools like Oracle SQL Developer, you can conveniently access the browser-based SQL Worksheet directly from your Autonomous Data Warehouse or Autonomous Transaction Processing console.

1. In your database's details page, click the **Database Actions** button.

    ![Click the Database Actions button](./images/click-database-actions-button.png " ")

2. A sign-in page opens for Database Actions. For this lab, simply use your database instance's default administrator account, **Username - admin**, and click **Next**.


    ![Enter the admin username.](./images/picture100-16.png " ")

3. Enter the Administrator **Password** you specified when creating the database. Click **Sign in**.

    ![Enter the admin password.](./images/picture100-16-password.png " ")

4. The Database Actions page opens. In the **Development** box, click **SQL**.

    ![Click on SQL.](./images/picture100-16-click-sql.png " ")

5. The first time you open SQL Worksheet, a series of pop-up informational boxes introduce you to the main features. Click **Next** to take a tour through the informational boxes.

4. The Database Actions page opens. In the **Development** box, click **SQL**.

## Task 4: Run scripts in SQL Worksheet

Run a query on a sample Oracle Autonomous Database data set.

1. Copy and paste the code snippet below to your SQL Worksheet. This query will run on the Star Schema Benchmark (ssb.customer), one of the two ADW sample data sets that you can access from any ADW instance. Take a moment to examine the script. Make sure you click the Run Statement button to run it in SQL Worksheet so that all the rows display on the screen.

        select /* low */ c_city,c_region,count(*)
        from ssb.customer c_low
        group by c_region, c_city
        order by count(*);

    ![Query Low Results SQL Worksheet](./images/ssb-query-low-results-sql-worksheet.png " ")

2. Take a look at the output response from your Autonomous Data Warehouse.

3. When possible, ADW also caches the results of a query for you.  If you run identical queries more than once, you will notice a much shorter response time when your results have been cached.

4. You can find more sample queries to run in the ADW documentation.
